Needed something to work on, and experiment with.
So, here is what I came up with. 'Recipe Keeper' screenshot here

As seen in the screenshot, there are entry boxes for: Recipe Name, Category, Difficulty/Time.
Also columns for items needed, such as: Ingredients, Utensils, and Other.
And a text box for instructions.

Just fill in the blanks and save your recipe to a folder of your choice.

Example:
Save As: Documents/Recipes/brownies

Of course, you could also create sub-category folders such as:
Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner | Desserts | Drinks | etc.
to keep recipes somewhat organized.
In which case, the path to your file would be (using the example above):
Documents/Recipes/Desserts/brownies

Will save as a text file, .txt is default extension so no need to add one.

Enjoy.
