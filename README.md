## Recipe Keeper
A place to keep your recipes

Needed something to work on, and experiment with.    
So, here is what I came up with. Recipe Keeper, screenshot [here](https://github.com/linuxlawson/recipe-keeper/blob/main/screenshot.png).  

Just fill in the entry boxes and save your recipe to a folder of your choice.  

Example:  
Save As: Documents/Recipes/brownies  

Of course, you could also create sub-category folders such as:  
Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner | Desserts | Drinks | etc.  
to keep recipes somewhat organized.  
In which case, the path to your file would be (using the example above):  
Documents/Recipes/Desserts/brownies

Will save as a text file, .txt is default extension so no need to add one.  

Enjoy.
